# Sentiment Analysis on Turkish Texts
In this project, I make a simple web application to analyze sentiments on Turkish. I use an e-commerce dataset which has "Rating" and "Review" columns and contains roughly 250.000 commments. Rating column is tagged as 1 for positive comments, 0 for negative comments. In the model, 3-layered LSTM architecture is used. At the end of training, 95% accuracy is obtained. 
All codes are written in Python and Flask is used as a web server.

This is just a template for now, more will be added soon!
